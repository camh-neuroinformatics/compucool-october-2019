	<a name="why"><h3>WHY?</h3></a>

	<p>Our research is increasingly more computationally-driven and training is often not part of the core curriculum for biomedical / medical science degrees.
 
The Scientific Computing Workshops at CAMH are focused on building computing skills and fundamentals to help organize study data, automate repeatable/reproducible analyses, and make use of CAMH computing resources to save time.
 
The workshops offer a range of topics and support different levels of experience.
 
We use a shared dataset - spanning demographic, cognitive, imaging, and genomic data - across all workshop, maintaining consistency across the series.
 
If you have questions, send us an email at SCWG@camh.ca</p>
